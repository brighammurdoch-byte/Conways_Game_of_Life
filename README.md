  This project is a recreation of Conway's Game of Life. I did this project as an assignment in my CS 1410 JavaScript Class. The source code includes the life simulator, 
  various patterns used in the game, and unit tests for the project. All unit tests pass and the game works as intended. Alterations may be made to the seed generation by
  going to lines 18-24 in ConwaysLife.java. Patterns can be inserted by adding simulation.insertPattern(new PatternName(), locationX, locationY) to this location.
